# Virtual-Reality-Based-Training-for-CBRN-Disaster-Response-Team-Name--ILLUSION-

In the introduction, trainees are briefed about the scenario.
For instance, they are informed that they are part of a CBRN response team and are called
to the scene of a chemical incident involving ammonium nitrate that has led to a potential
leak.
The information might include the quantity of ammonium nitrate involved and the potential
hazards associated with it.
Trainees virtually arrive at the scene, facing an overturned lorry carrying ammonium nitrate
fertilizer.
There's a smoldering fire near the lorry and a visible crater marks the point of the
explosion.
Trainees can explore the 360-degree virtual environment.
During the initial assessment, trainees must check for casualties and evaluate the safety
of the area.
For example, they find five casualties, two with minor burns and three showing signs of
severe respiratory distress due to exposure to ammonium nitrate fumes.
Sevenes make critical decisions.
For example, they must decide whether to approach the leaking ammonium nitrate or establish
a safety perimeter first.
These choices influence the outcome of the scenario.
Participants establish communication with their CBRN command centre.
They report the situation, share critical information such as the type and quantity of
ammonium nitrate involved and request support or guidance based on their initial assessment.
Trainees are guided on how to approach the leaking ammonium nitrate safely.
For example, they may need to employ tools to contain the leak, like sandbags or a neutralising
agent to prevent further contamination.
Participants for measuring ammonium nitrate levels are provided and trainees must assess
the risk of further incidents.
For example, they use a virtual and level monitor and see that ammonium nitrate levels are
within the critical range, indicating a potential for another explosion.
After completing this scenario, participants receive an analysis of their performance.
For instance, they're informed that their response time was adequate, but there were
areas where they could improve such as communication with command.
This information is then sent on to the admin using Google's Firebase, where they can actively
keep a track on the trainees and check on their progress.
